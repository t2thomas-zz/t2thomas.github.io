  <h1>Tittu Thomas Nellimoottil, PhD </h1>
  <p>I am passionate about Data Science. </p>
  <p>My previous work has been in mathematical optimization including Mixed Integer Linear Programming, Point Registration, Simulated Annealing and Metropolis Hastings Algorithm.
  I have implemented graph algorithms like simple path enumeration, shortes paths and max-flow as part of my work. </p>
  <p>I am good with C#, Python, R, SQL, OPL (IBM Optimization Modeling Language). Recently I have been dabbling in Map-Reduce and Hadoop.</p>
<p>Some simple, but interesting algorithms I wrote recently in Python:</p>
<ul>

  <li>Boyer Moore 1/3rd Majority Algorithm </li>
</ul>
